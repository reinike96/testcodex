## Mario Game

This repository includes a simple Mario-like platformer written in Python using Pygame. To run the game:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 mario.py
   ```

Use the arrow keys to move and jump with the space bar. Avoid enemies and stay on the platforms. The camera follows Mario as he moves to the right.
