## Mario Game

This repository includes a basic Mario-style platformer written in Python using Pygame. Collect coins and avoid the enemy while the camera scrolls horizontally. To run the game:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python3 mario.py
   ```

Use the arrow keys to move and jump with the space bar. Collect all coins and avoid touching the enemy. The camera follows the player as they move to the right.
